# Engagement Time Counter

Tracks user engagement time on the page by monitoring activity (mouse, keyboard, scroll, touch). It calculates both session engagement time and total page engagement time, storing the data in localStorage and sessionStorage. The script resets engagement counters on session start or inactivity (after a specified timeout). It sends engagement data to the server when the page is unloaded or blurred.
